# psaform-java

A project for our Object Oriented Programming

### Description

This application intends to encode data for PSA Employees using low memory and can be used on slow computers. 

### Problem Statement

At PSA, employees there encode data from peoples birth certificate filled up form in order to track names and other such things, but there is no way on to encode them to a database. Accessing the database in a raw manner might be very vulnerable to data loss or tampering. Using browsers to fill up will take more memory since their computers are low-end just for office work and cannot handle it. So a light program will help them to encode data from paper to computer data with authentication and limitations.
